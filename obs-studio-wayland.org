* Use obs-studio on wayland

I couldn't get obs-studio to work first try, like right after installing it on wayland (arch-linux).
I wasn't able to see any output.

To fix it, after install it obs-studio, I've installed : =obs-vaapi= and =wlrobs=

You should be able to then see some new entry about *wayland (dmabuf)*, this is the one you should use to access your displays.
